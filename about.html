                Hey there, wondering why did I create this website? <br> Here's an answer for it. <br> Actually
                I created this website for my friend whose name is honey. She started showing her interest in origami when she
                was just 8 years old. As you may have seen all the pictures of camel, chameleon, etc. were all created by her. 
                She is a very creative girl and wanted to make a website to showcase her talent on the internet. So I created this website for her. <br>
                We hope you liked the website.
